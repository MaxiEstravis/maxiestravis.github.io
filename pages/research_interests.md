title: Research interests

My main research interest is understanding how plant individuals and populations cope with environmental variations such as those caused by Global Climate Change, and whether or not they will ultimately be able to adapt. To answer these questions, I'm interested in contributions from diverse fields such as population genetics and genomics, ecophysiology, molecular biology and _-omics_. In fact, I believe that only by integrating all these disciplines will we be able to achieve answers to the important questions in biology and life sciences.

Personally, my strongest background is in bioinformatics so I am particularly interested in integrating genetics, the regulation of transcription, and post-translational and metabolic alterations in response to environmental stimuli via the analysis of datasets produced by massive DNA sequencing.
