title: Biography and background
---

I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ever since I was a kid I had a fascination with plants and the natural world in general. Back then, I wanted to become an Agricultural Engineer since I thought that was what people who liked plants did for a living. I had a palm and a viola in my childhood apartment.

Biology and Chemistry teachers in high school lit my scientific spirit and that was when I decided that I wanted to study Biology. I completed my undergraduate studies in the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), specializing in Botany. My first steps in research were in IFEVA (UBA-CONICET) studying blue light photomorphogenesis in _Arabidopsis thaliana_.

A summer backpacking trip with friends to northern Patagonia made me realize that I wanted to live and work there, advancing the knowledge and contributing to the conservation of such a fascinating and fragile ecosystem as the temperate Patagonian forest. Next year, in 2014, I began my PhD in Bariloche, the turistic and cultural capital of the Lake District, studying the responses to high temperature in three native tree species, in the context of Global Climate Change.

During my PhD I got to travel to labs in France and Germany and present my work in several national and international meetings and conferences.

At present I am conducting my postdoc research in Bariloche contributing to the interdisciplinary study of native tree species.
